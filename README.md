# SniperX-V3

This repository contains scripts used for monitoring tokens and running automated analyses.

## Environment Variables

Some scripts rely on environment variables for locating required data files. The most important one is:

- `TOKEN_RISK_ANALYSIS_CSV` â€“ Optional. Absolute path to `token_risk_analysis.csv` used by `Monitoring.py`. If not set, the file is expected to be located in the same directory as the script.

Set this variable in your environment or a `.env` file to ensure the scripts can locate the CSV on both Windows and Unix-like systems.
